                Dear Friend,
                <br>
                <br>
              </small>
              <br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp; I have no idea how you got to this website.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe you read about it in some
                publication.&nbsp; Maybe a friend referred you to it.&nbsp;
                Perhaps you stumbled onto it by pure dumb luck.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; But, however you got here, you have arrived at
                what is, without question, the most valuable website on the
                entire Internet!<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; Here's why: Back in September of 1986,
                I began publishing a newsletter cleverly called The Gary
                Halbert Letter.&nbsp; The subscription price was $195.00
                per year and, with very little promotion, I soon had readers in more
                than 50 countries.&nbsp; Then, I started offering a Lifetime
                Subscription for $2,855.00.
              </small>
            </p>
            <p align="left">
              <small>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, guess what?&nbsp;&nbsp;It
                wasn't long until nearly all my subscribers were Lifetime
                Subscribers!<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; Since I began writing this newsletter, I have
                received thousands upon thousands
                of letters from people telling me how my newsletters have helped them
                make millions (sometimes tens of millions) of
                dollars, saved their health (and, in some cases, literally saved their
                lives), kept their marriages intact... and... in various other ways... improved
                their lives immensely.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; So, I got to thinking, "Well, hell... if
                what I write helps people this much, it should be available to
                everyone... even if... they can't afford to subscribe to my newsletter."
                Therefore, I've put all my newsletters (with some very sparse editing)
                right here on this website... for... everyone in the world...
                to read...
              </small>
            </p>
            <p align="center">
              <small><b><u>Absolutely</u> <u>Free</u>!</b></small>
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;
              <small>Just click below where it says
                "Newsletter Menu"... then... you'll be taken to a page where you'll see
                a forest of envelope icons with "Headlines" on them.
              </small>
              <small>
                <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;
                Each envelope contains one issue of my newsletter.&nbsp; And, as
                you'll soon see, the subject of each individual newsletter is
                identified on the front of the envelope.&nbsp; If it looks like any
                particular newsletter would be of interest to you, just click on the
                envelope it's in... and... shazam!... the entire
                text of that issue will appear instantly (no downloading required) on
                your computer screen.</small> <small>You
                can read it on your screen, print it out and read it, schmuck it onto a
                floppy disk or CD... or... whatever your little heart desires.
              </small><br>
              <br>
              <small>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; It's 100% free.&nbsp; There's nothing you have
              to buy... and... on this website...

                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever.&nbsp; Anyway, I write a new issue of
                my newsletter approximately every 30-days... and... if you want to know
                immediately when a new issue is posted,
                just click below and send me your e-mail address. Then, I'll send you a
                one-line e-mail message each month telling you the brand new
                issue is now on the website.

                these newsletters as thousands of others have.
